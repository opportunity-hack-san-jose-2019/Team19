# Team19 (Braven_Maverick) - Interviewer-Interviewee matching algorithm for Braven

Braven strives to reduce the education-to-employment gap among the students by providing mentoring, mock interviews etc for the students. The challenge faced by Braven is to schedule the mock interviews of a candidate with an interviewer with matching skill set. Another important problem they want to address is scalability. 

We have designed an application with scalable  architecture which can intelligently recommend an interviewer to match with the candidate.
